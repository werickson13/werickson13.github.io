I am the current president of the Hydrology club at UCSB, and work as a student lead at the Associated Students Food Bank. I will also be interning for the Santa Clara Valley Water District as a Hydrographer in the Hydrology, Hydraulics, and Geomorphology unit.\nThrough my UCSB courses I have experience in hydrologic, geologic, and pedologic field work. I also have experience with related software programs, including but not limited to: QGIS, RStudio, Excel, and Adobe Illustrator.\nI love to be outside, and spend my free time hiking in the Santa Ynez Mountains, surfing, running, gardening, and playing the guitar."

    "text": "Fieldwork Sites\nThis map shows the locations in the Mojave Desert I’ve done field work at. Listed below is more information about each site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelbaker Road\nThis site was during my first ever trip to the Mojave. We were studying the soils along the alluvial fan located next to Kelbaker Road. We dug and analyzed three soil pits. This was my first time seeing a vesticular soil horizon, as well as a petrocalcic horizon.  \n\n\nNorris Camp\nNorris Camp is a UC research station where we were allowed to camp. At this site I was able to practice analyzing and describing granite, aplite, and mafic enclaves.  \n\n\nPiute Gorge\nAt Piute Gorge, I was able to map and describe extensional faulting in the area. I took detailed notes on rock units throughout the gorge, as well as contacts and implied geologic history.   \n\n\nPisgah Crater\nMy class and I analyzed mineralogy to identify three separate lava flows at Pisgah Crater. Using this data, as well as other field observations, we were able to deduce the order of these flows.  \n\n\nPinto Mountain\nWhile hiking up Pinto Mountain, I was able to analyze and describe the different cooling and eruptive units that make up the mountain.   \n\n\nRock Spring\nI worked with my class to analyze the relationships between different intermediate and felsic rocks in order to deduce geologic history. A notable find on this excursion were sizable formations and cross-cuts of epidote."
