## Hobbies

I love to be outside, and spend my free time hiking in the Santa Ynez Mountains, surfing, running, gardening, and playing the guitar. Pictured here is the wildflower garden that I planted in my front yard in Isla Vista. <br> ![](photos/IMG_6335.jpeg){width="800"}

## Cooking/Baking

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I gained a passion for cooking and baking. I have carried that passion with me to college, and can often be found cooking for my entire house.<br> ![](photos/IMG_5157.jpeg){height="200"} ![](photos/IMG_1211.jpeg){height="200"} ![](photos/IMG_2549.jpeg){height="200"}

## Pets

I have two dogs: Tootsie (half chocolate lab and half german shorthair) and Violet (weimaraner). <br>
