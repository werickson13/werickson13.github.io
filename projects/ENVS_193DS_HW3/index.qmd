```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) #load packages
library(gt)
library(here)
library(janitor)

```

## Problem 1. Personal Data

#### a. Data Summarizing

-   I can calculate the mean water usage on each day of the week, and compare those means to one another because I think I may use more water on certain days. Over the weekend I have more free time, so I think I will use more water (for example, taking longer showers, doing more laundry, etc.) on Saturday than other days of the week.

#### b. Visualization

This code creates a chart displaying the data I collected on daily water usage.

```{r}
data_c <- water_data |> #use water dataframe
  clean_names() |>  #clean up column names
  mutate(week_day = recode(week_day,#rename values in week_day column
                           "monday" = "Monday",
                           "tuesday" = "Tuesday",
                           "wednesday" = "Wednesday",
                           "thursday" = "Thursday",
                           "friday" = "Friday",
                           "saturday" = "Saturday",
                           "sunday" = "Sunday")) |> 
  select(week_day,water_total)#view only day and total water columns
print(data_c) #display selected columns from dataframe
data_c$week_day <- factor(data_c$week_day, #rearrange cagegories to display as Monday - Sunday
                             levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
ggplot(data_c, aes(x = week_day, y = water_total, color = week_day)) + #create jitterplot using water total and week day
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.5)+ #set parameters for plot
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.05, color = "black") + #create error bar
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 4, color = "darkred")+ #create mean point
  theme_dark(base_size = 14) + #set theme
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA), #set panel background color
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray", color = NA), #set plot background color
    legend.position = "none" #remove legend
  ) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Monday" = "blue", "Tuesday" = "darkgreen", "Wednesday" = "purple", "Thursday" = "darkorange", "Friday" = "cyan", "Saturday" = "green", "Sunday" = "brown1")) + #set point color
  labs(
    title = "Mean Water Usage Across Days of the Week", #set title
    subtitle = "Wyatt Erickson", #set subtitle
    x = "Day of the Week", #set x axis title
    y = "Water Usage (gallons)" #set y axis title
  )
```

#### c. Caption

Figure 1: Figure shows mean water usage (gallons) for each day of the week. Mean values represented with dark red points, standard error represented by black error bars. Monday values shown with blue circles, Tuesday with dark green, Wednesday with purple, Friday with orange, Saturday with cyan, and Sunday with light red. Data shows higher mean water usage on Saturday and Sunday, with the highest mean on Sunday. In this figure, outliers were not excluded from the data.

#### d. Table Presentation

This code creates a table summary for mean water usage.

```{r}
data_summary <- data_c |> #use cleaned dataframe
  group_by(week_day) |> #calculate based on week day
  summarize(mean = mean(water_total)) |> #calculate mean
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 1))) #round values to one decimal place

data_summary |> #use summarized dataframe
  gt() |> #use gt package
  cols_label( #set column names
    week_day = "Weekday",
    mean = "Mean (Gallons)", 
  ) |> 
  tab_header( #add table title
    title = "Mean Water Usage Summary"
  ) |> 
  tab_style( #make column labels bold
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything())
  )
```

## Problem 2. Affective Visualization

#### a. Affective Visualization Description

-   One idea I have to visualize my data is to display the line created by a scatterplot with date as the x-axis and water usage as the y-axis. I could draw lines up to each point, and divide these lines between at-home water usage and away from home water usage, which I collected in my original excel sheet. This display would show day-to day variation in water usage. I could also assign colors or different saturations of a single color to each day of the week.

#### b. Create a Sketch

#### c. Visualization Draft

![](Data/data_visualization.png)

#### d. Artist Statement

In the above visualization, the relationship between daily water usage is shown through an image created in adobe illustrator and inspired by Lorraine Woodruff-Long's warming strips quilt. I plotted the data points for water usage by day as a scatterplot, and drew lines up to each point, curving the edges for days where there was only at-home water usage and assigning each day of the week a color pattern.

## Problem 3. Statistical Critique

#### a. Revisit and Summarize

The authors are using an ANOVA test to analyze differences in gravel sphericity and roundness between different terraces and locations. In terraces with a statistically significant difference from one another, they are represented with an r, meaning that the null hypothesis for that specific relationship is rejected. This analysis of variance compares mean grain size values throughout the river, and determines if the difference in these means is due to chance, or truly dependent on how upstream or downstream each grain is.

#### b. Visual Clarity

The table does a good job representing and conveying the results of the ANOVA test, and showing what values are and are not statistically significant. The key at the bottom efficiently elaborates key details of this description.

#### c. Aesthetic Clarity

There is not much "visual clutter" present in this table. The data is concise, with a key at the bottom and values that show only the results with no other full sentence explanations. The inclusion of an r indicating a rejected null hypothesis is a concise indicator of the interpretation of these results, without needing a separate table.

#### d. Recommendations

One thing I might add to this table is a grid separating values. With eight rows and six columns of numbers present, it can seem a bit jumbled, and a grid with a low line weight could help the readability. Also, the Y and R metrics could be added to the key at the bottom of the table. While it is mentioned further up in the text that these represent sphericity and roundness, it would be a good idea for clarity to re-emphasize what these variables represent, as they did with "T = terrace".
