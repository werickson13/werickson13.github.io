I'm a third year Hydrologic Sciences and Policy major at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am the current president of the Hydrology club at UCSB, and work as a student lead at the Associated Students Food Bank. I will also be interning for the Santa Clara Valley Water District as a Hydrographer in the Hydrology, Hydraulics, and Geomorphology unit.

Through my UCSB courses I have experience in hydrologic, geologic, and pedologic field work. I also have experience with related software programs, including but not limited to: QGIS, RStudio, Excel, and Adobe Illustrator.
