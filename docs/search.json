    "text": "Problem 2. Affective Visualization\n\na. Affective Visualization Description\n\nOne idea I have to visualize my data is to display the line created by a scatterplot with date as the x-axis and water usage as the y-axis. I could draw lines up to each point, and divide these lines between at-home water usage and away from home water usage, which I collected in my original excel sheet. This display would show day-to day variation in water usage. I could also assign colors or different saturations of a single color to each day of the week.\n\n\n\nb. Create a Sketch\n\n\n\nc. Visualization Draft\n\n\n\nd. Artist Statement\nIn the above visualization, the relationship between daily water usage is shown through an image created in adobe illustrator and inspired by Lorraine Woodruff-Long’s warming strips quilt. I plotted the data points for water usage by day as a scatterplot, and drew lines up to each point, curving the edges for days where there was only at-home water usage and assigning each day of the week a color pattern."

    "text": "Problem 3. Statistical Critique\n\na. Revisit and Summarize\nThe authors are using an ANOVA test to analyze differences in gravel sphericity and roundness between different terraces and locations. In terraces with a statistically significant difference from one another, they are represented with an r, meaning that the null hypothesis for that specific relationship is rejected. This analysis of variance compares mean grain size values throughout the river, and determines if the difference in these means is due to chance, or truly dependent on how upstream or downstream each grain is.\n\n\n\nb. Visual Clarity\nThe table does a good job representing and conveying the results of the ANOVA test, and showing what values are and are not statistically significant. The key at the bottom efficiently elaborates key details of this description.\n\n\nc. Aesthetic Clarity\nThere is not much “visual clutter” present in this table. The data is concise, with a key at the bottom and values that show only the results with no other full sentence explanations. The inclusion of an r indicating a rejected null hypothesis is a concise indicator of the interpretation of these results, without needing a separate table.\n\n\nd. Recommendations\nOne thing I might add to this table is a grid separating values. With eight rows and six columns of numbers present, it can seem a bit jumbled, and a grid with a low line weight could help the readability. Also, the Y and R metrics could be added to the key at the bottom of the table. While it is mentioned further up in the text that these represent sphericity and roundness, it would be a good idea for clarity to re-emphasize what these variables represent, as they did with “T = terrace”."

Listed below is more information about each site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelbaker Road\nThis site was during my first ever trip to the Mojave. We were studying the soils along the alluvial fan located next to Kelbaker Road. We dug and analyzed three soil pits. This was my first time seeing a vesticular soil horizon, as well as a petrocalcic horizon.  \n\n\nNorris Camp\nNorris Camp is a UC research station where we were allowed to camp. At this site I was able to practice analyzing and describing granite, aplite, and mafic enclaves.  \n\n\nPiute Gorge\nAt Piute Gorge, I was able to map and describe extensional faulting in the area. I took detailed notes on rock units throughout the gorge, as well as contacts and implied geologic history.   \n\n\nPisgah Crater\nMy class and I analyzed mineralogy to identify three separate lava flows at Pisgah Crater. Using this data, as well as other field observations, we were able to deduce the order of these flows.  \n\n\nPinto Mountain\nWhile hiking up Pinto Mountain, I was able to analyze and describe the different cooling and eruptive units that make up the mountain.   \n\n\nRock Spring\nI worked with my class to analyze the relationships between different intermediate and felsic rocks in order to deduce geologic history. A notable find on this excursion were sizable formations and cross-cuts of epidote."

    "text": "Purpose\nThis map was created for a report on the Kootenai River basin. There is an ongoing issue with selenium and nitrate contamination in the water due to upstream coal mining. These coal mines leech these pollutants from large piles of waste rock. The elevated levels of selenium have had a detrimental impact on the trout population in the upper Kootenai basin, with many hatching with extreme deformities or simply not being able to develop. The map here showcases the flow of this river basin, as well as the extent of these mining operations."
