#### Fieldwork Sites

This map shows the locations in the Mojave Desert I've done field work at. Listed below is more information about each site.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(here)

# read in data
locations <- read_csv(file = here::here("map_data", "locations.csv"))

# cleaning and filtering
sites <- locations |> 
  select(site_name, lat, long) |> 
  distinct()

# create icon
hammer_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = here::here("photos", "hammer_icon.png"),
  iconWidth = 50, iconHeight = 50
)
# initialize map ----
site_map <- leaflet() |> 
  
  # add base map tiles ----
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group = "ESRI World Imagery") |> 
  
  # set view over Mojave National Preserve ----
  setView(lng = -115.43, lat = 35.0, zoom = 9) |> 

  # add markers ----
  addMarkers(data = sites,
             icon = hammer_icon,
             lng = ~long, lat = ~lat,
             popup = paste("Site Name:", sites$site_name, "<br>",
                           "Coordinates (lat/long):", sites$lat, ",", sites$long)) |> 

  #add reset map button ----
  leaflet.extras::addResetMapButton()

# print map----

### Kelbaker Road

This site was during my first ever trip to the Mojave. We were studying the soils along the alluvial fan located next to Kelbaker Road. We dug and analyzed three soil pits. This was my first time seeing a vesticular soil horizon, as well as a petrocalcic horizon. :::{layout="horizontal"} ![](photos/IMG_5331.jpeg){width="150"} ![](photos/IMG_6176.jpeg){width="\"150"} :::

### Norris Camp

Norris Camp is a UC research station where we were allowed to camp. At this site I was able to practice analyzing and describing granite, aplite, and mafic enclaves.

### Piute Gorge

At Piute Gorge, I was able to map and describe extensional faulting in the area. I took detailed notes on rock units throughout the gorge, as well as contacts and implied geologic history.

### Pisgah Crater

My class and I analyzed mineralogy to identify three separate lava flows at Pisgah Crater. Using this data, as well as other field observations, we were able to deduce the order of these flows.

### Pinto Mountain

While hiking up Pinto Mountain, I was able to analyze and describe the different cooling and eruptive units that make up the mountain.

### Rock Spring

I worked with my class to analyze the relationships between different intermediate and felsic rocks in order to deduce geologic history. A notable find on this excursion were sizable formations and cross-cuts of epidote.
